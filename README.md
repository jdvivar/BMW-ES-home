## Things to do üìù

### 1. Add a title
- Set the same title found on the original website (www.bmw.es)
  > Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title

### 2. Add missing HTML content
- Find the HTML comments where it says `<!-- Add missing content here -->`
- Scan the original website, the written HTML and add the missing content following the same structure

### 3. Add missing images
- There are some missing images (you **should** have added some more in the previous step!)
- Uncomment them
- Find the images on the original website (www.bmw.es) and add them to the `/assets` folder
- Rename the images to suit your needs
  > Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img
- We will be adding the top header image as a background image so there's no HTML for it

### 4. Add a website icon
- Use the same icon found on the original website
- The standard name for this image file is `favicon.ico`
  > Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link

### 5. Add a font üíÖ
- Use either IBM Plex Sans or Gothic A1 from Google Fonts
- Using an import at-rule, import it from the `style.css` file 
  > Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import
- Use the font! Set a rule like so:
  ```css
  html {
    font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;
  }
  ```
  > Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family

### 6. Add class names
- Read about CSS naming conventions
  > Recommendation: BEM http://getbem.com/
- Add classes to HTML
